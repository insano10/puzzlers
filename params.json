Determine if a string has all unique characters\r\n  1. Determine if a string has all unique characters (without using additional data structures)\r\n  1. Reverse a string\r\n  1. Reverse a C-style string\r\n  1. Is a string an anagram of another\r\n* Arrays\r\n  1. Rotate an NxN 2D array by 90 degrees\r\n  1. Rotate an NxM 2D array by 90 degrees\r\n  1. Traverse an NxN 2D array in a spiral pattern\r\n  1. Traverse an NxM 2D array in a spiral pattern\r\n* Sorting\r\n  1. QuickSort (using additional data structures)\r\n  1.
