Given a set of meetings find the amount of time someone spends in a meeting that conflicts with others

Questions:

- How granular do we want the time to be?

    - Realistically no one schedules a meeting to more than minute level accuracy so let's measure our conflicting time in minutes

- What does it mean to conflict with others?

    - The easiest interpretation of this is to include all time that 2 people are both in a meeting, regardless of whether it is the
      same meeting or not. However this would look stupid in a meeting planner so I will exclude time where the people are both
      in the same meeting

- What gotchas do we expect?

    - scheduling meetings in different time zones
    - people attending the same meeting are not overlapping their time
    - double counting >2 meetings at the same time
    - double counting time periods across multiple intervals (i.e. one interval could be a sub-range of another)
