Given a set of meetings find the amount of time someone spends in a meeting that conflicts with others

Questions:

- How granular do we want the time to be?

    - Realistically no one schedules a meeting to more than minute level accuracy so let's measure our conflicting time in minutes

- What does it mean to conflict with others?

    - The easiest interpretation of this is to include all time that 2 people are both in a meeting, regardless of whether it is the
      same meeting or not. However this would look stupid in a meeting planner so I will exclude time where the people are both
      in the same meeting
