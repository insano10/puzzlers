# Puzzlers

This is a collection of various algorithms and puzzles that I have come across over the years that are interesting/useful enough to keep note of.
They have been implemented in Java.

Note: The implementations here are by no means the best or most elegant solutions, just what I have come up with.

## Algorithms

* Strings
  1. Determine if a string has all unique characters
  1. Determine if a string has all unique characters (without using additional data structures)
  1. Reverse a string
  1. Reverse a C-style string
  1. Is a string an anagram of another
* Arrays
  1. Rotate an NxN 2D array by 90 degrees
  1. Rotate an NxM 2D array by 90 degrees
  1. Traverse an NxN 2D array in a spiral pattern
  1. Traverse an NxM 2D array in a spiral pattern
* Sorting
  1. QuickSort (using additional data structures)
  1. QuickSort (using ArrayLists instead of arrays)
  1. QuickSort (in place, without additional data structures)
  1. HeapSort
  1. ExternalSort
* Linked Lists
  1. Add/Remove/Get
  1. Remove duplicate elements
  1. Remove duplicate elements (without using additional data structures)
  1. Sort
* Sets
  1. Write an algorithm to to generate the powerset of any given set
    * implement recursively
    * implement iteratively
    * implement using a binary string
* Heaps
  1. Implement a min-heap
  2. Implement a max-heap
* Graphs
  1. Depth first search
    * recursively
    * iteratively
  1. Breadth first search
  1. Dijkstra's algorithm

## Puzzles

* Solutions to the excellent puzzles posted by Wouter Coekaerts at http://wouter.coekaerts.be/puzzles
  1. Fit 20 clowns into a 5 seat Volkswagen
  1. Am I still dreaming?
* Given a set of meetings find the amount of time someone spends in a meeting that conflicts with others
* Find the running median of a stream of Integers
* Given a 10x10 grid, a guy on one space, his house on another and some obstacles on the grid, find the shortest path home
