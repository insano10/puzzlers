# Puzzlers

This is a collection of various algorithms that I have come across over the years that are interesting/useful enough to keep note of. 

Note: The implementations here are by no means the best or most elegant solutions, just what I have come up with.

## Algorithms

* Strings
* Arrays
  1. Rotate an NxN 2D array by 90 degrees
  1. Rotate an NxM 2D array by 90 degrees
  1. Traverse an NxN 2D array in a spiral pattern
  1. Traverse an NxM 2D array in a spiral pattern
* Linked Lists
