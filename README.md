# Puzzlers

This is a collection of various algorithms that I have come across over the years that are interesting/useful enough to keep note of.
They have been implemented in Java.

Note: The implementations here are by no means the best or most elegant solutions, just what I have come up with.

## Algorithms

* Strings
  1. Determine if a string has all unique characters
  1. Determine if a string has all unique characters (without using additional data structures)
  1. Reverse a string
  1. Reverse a C-style string
  1. Is a string an anagram of another
* Arrays
  1. Rotate an NxN 2D array by 90 degrees
  1. Rotate an NxM 2D array by 90 degrees
  1. Traverse an NxN 2D array in a spiral pattern
  1. Traverse an NxM 2D array in a spiral pattern
* Sorting
  1. QuickSort (using additional data structures)
  1. QuickSort (using ArrayLists instead of arrays)
  1. QuickSort (in place, without additional data structures)
* Linked Lists
  1. Add/Remove/Get
  1. Remove duplicate elements
  1. Remove duplicate elements (without using additional data structures)
  1. Sort
